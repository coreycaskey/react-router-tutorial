# React Router Demo

This is a completed example of the [React Router Demo](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial), with the addition of TypeScript and some minor (preference) deviations from the tutorial.

1. I used named exports over `default` exports because I prefer import and export names to be the same, and this is is the easiest way to enforce it.

2. I used function expressions with arrow syntax over function declarations. I just like them better.

3. I split out certain interfaces, constants, and JSX to make the repo more modular and readable
